#JO the OJ Robot 

This project was created using the Botkit starter kit for web, created with the [Yeoman generator](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/tree/master/packages/generator-botkit#readme).

We are two friends that wanted a bot to introduce us and our friendship. 

[Botkit Docs](https://botkit.ai/docs/v4)

This bot is powered by [a folder full of modules](https://botkit.ai/docs/v4/core.html#organize-your-bot-code). 
Edit the samples, and add your own in the [features/](features/) folder.
